# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 5.3.1 - Loops - Using FOR loops activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will use ``||LOOPS:for index from 0 to 4||`` loop blocks to add some functionality to our Minecraft game.

In this program we will program our agent to build a wall of blocks of a length we can pass into the chat command

## Step 2
From the Player drawer drag out a ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` event block and change it to respond to the chat command **build**
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("build",function () {
 
})
```

## Step 3
From the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer place an ``||AGENT:agent teleport to player||`` block and an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block inside the on chat block.

This will move the Minecraft MakeCode Agent to your current position.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("build",function () {
	agent.teleportToPlayer()
	agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
})
```

## Step 4
From the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer place a ``||LOOPS:for index from 0 to 4||`` block after the ``||AGENT:agent teleport to player||`` block
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("build", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for (let index = 0; index <= 4; index++) {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 5
From the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer place an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block and an ``||AGENT:agent place back||``  block inside the for loop.

This will cause our agent to move forward by one and lay a block behind them.

If we run our code now the agent will place 5 blocks.

Next we will change the chat command to allow us to provide the number of blocks to lay.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("build", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for (let index = 0; index <= 4; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.place(BACK)
    }
})
```

## Step 6
Click on the + symbol to the right of the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "build"||`` block to add a variable to pass into this command.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("build", function (num1) {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for (let index = 0; index <= 4; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.place(BACK)
    }
})
```

## Step 7
Click on the downward arrow of the variable num1 which was created and rename the variable to length

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("build", function (length) {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for (let index = 0; index <= 4; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.place(BACK)
    }
})
```

## Step 8
From the variables drawer drag the length variable and place it on the number 4 in the for loop.

This changes the for loop to respond to the number we have passed into the build command.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("build", function (length) {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for (let index = 0; index <= length; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.place(BACK)
    }
})
```

## Step 9 @unplugged
To test your code:
1. Return to your Minecraft world and ensure you are on the ground and not flying. Ensure your agent has some blocks in their inventory.
![alt text](https://github.com/Prodigy-Learning/CodingInMinecraft-Intermediate/blob/master/Lesson5/5.3.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "FOR")
2. Run the chat command build 3 and observe your agent build a wall.
![alt text](https://github.com/Prodigy-Learning/CodingInMinecraft-Intermediate/blob/master/Lesson5/5.3.1/images/2.jpg?raw=true "FOR")
Did you notice how many blocks were placed? We specified that we wanted a wall of 3 blocks by passing the number 3 in yet the agent placed 4 blocks. Do you know why this is?

Remember to for loop enumerates from 0 to the number specified therefore when we pass in the number 3 the loop will enumerate when the loop control variable is 0, 1, 2 and 3 - 4 times in total!
