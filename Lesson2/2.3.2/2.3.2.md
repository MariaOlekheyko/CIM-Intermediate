# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 2.3.2 - Using Variables to count Activity - Performing Subtraction

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
At the moment if you mine a block the count of grass blocks is unchanged.

We will create some code to subtract 1 from the ``||VARIABLES:b||`` variable when we break a grass block.

```template
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS, function () {
    b += 1
})
player.onChat("countblocks", function () {
    player.say("Blocks Used:" + b)
})
```

## Step 2
Drag out an ``||BLOCKS:on block broken||`` block from the ``||BLOCKS:BLOCKS||`` drawer
Leave the block as the default ``||BLOCKS:Grass||`` block
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(GRASS, function () {
	
})

```
## Step 3
Drag a ``||VARIABLES:set b to 0||``  block from the Variables drawer.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(GRASS, function () {
	b = 0
})
```

## Step 4
From the ``||MATH:MATH||`` drawer drag a ``||MATH:0 - 0||`` block and place it on the 0 in the ``||VARIABLES:set b to 0||`` block

From the Variables drawer drag a ``||VARIABLES:b||`` variable and drop it on the first part of the subtraction.

Change the 2nd number in the subtraction  to 1
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS, function () {
    b = b-1
})
```


## Step 5 @unplugged
To test your code:
1. Add some grass blocks to your inventory if you dont already have some and place and break some grass blocks. Keep a count of how many you place and how many you break.

2. Bring up the chat window and type countblocks and press the Enter key - it should display the total number of blocks still placed
